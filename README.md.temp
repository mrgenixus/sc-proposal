Built as a 'Sure I can do that' project that was never quite used to pitch a potential client: Silver Canyon Coffee Company, a roaster in Colorado. Though the pitch was never made, this work was a formative example of pre-ajax front-end work that became the basis for later work with front-end javascript.
